Geologic Time Scale</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;To be able to discuss Earth history, scientists needed some way to refer to the time periods in which events happened and organisms lived. With the information they collected from fossil evidence and using Steno&rsquo;s principles, they created a listing of rock layers from oldest to youngest. Then they divided Earth&rsquo;s history into blocks of time with each block separated by important events, such as the disappearance of a species of fossil from the rock record. Since many of the scientists who first assigned names to times in Earth&rsquo;s history were from Europe, they named the blocks of time from towns or other local places where the rock layers that represented that time were found.</span></p>

The Paleozoic Era</span></strong><span style="font-size:38px;line-height:107%;"><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Paleozoic is the earliest era of the Phanerozoic. The Paleozoic was also the longest era of the Phanerozoic. But the Paleozoic was relatively recent. It began only 570 million years ago. At the start of the Paleozoic, there was a supercontinent called Rodinia. The supercontinent broke apart during the early part of the Paleozoic.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Phanerozoic is recent history compared with the Precambrian. This is one reason that the Paleozoic is much better known than the Precambrian. Another reason is that Paleozoic organisms had hard parts, and they fossilized better.<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong><br>&nbsp;Formation of Pangaea</strong>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; A mountain-building event is called an orogeny. Orogenies take place over tens or hundreds of millions of years. Continents smash into each other. Microcontinents and island arcs smash into continents. All of these events cause mountains to rise.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;When Pangaea came together there were orogenies all along the collision zones. Geologists find much evidence of these orogenies. For example, Laurentia collided with the Taconic Island Arc during the Taconic Orogeny. The remnants of this mountain range make up the Taconic Mountains in New York.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Laurentia experienced other orogenies as it collided with the northern continents. The southern continents came together to form Gondwana. When Laurentia and Gondwana collided to create Pangaea, the Appalachians rose. Geologists think the Appalachians were once higher than the Himalayas are now.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Pangaea</strong>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; Pangaea was the last supercontinent on Earth. Evidence for the existence of Pangaea was what Alfred Wegener used to create his continental drift hypothesis. Continental drift was described in Concept Plate Tectonics. As the continents move, the shape of the oceans changes too. At the time of Pangaea, most of Earth&rsquo;s water was collected in a huge ocean. This ocean was called Panthalassa</span></p>

The Mesozoic Era</span></strong><span style="font-size:38px;line-height:107%;"><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;A continent is like a giant blanket that traps heat. Heat from the mantle comes up but cannot escape through the continent.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <strong>Supercontinent Breakup</strong><br>&nbsp; Why would a supercontinent break up? Remember that Earth&apos;s interior is hot. Heat builds up beneath the supercontinent. This causes the continent to buoy upward. Continental rifting begins. Basalt lava fills in the rift. This could lead to seafloor spreading and the formation of a new ocean basin. This basalt province is where Africa is splitting apart and generating basalt lavad<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>The Breakup of Pangaea</strong>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; At the end of the Paleozoic, there was one continent and one ocean. Then Pangaea began to break apart about 180 million years ago. The Panthalassa Ocean separated into the individual but interconnected oceans that we see today on Earth.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Continental rifting and then seafloor spreading pushed Africa and South America. The Atlantic Ocean basin formed in between the continents. Seafloor spreading continues to enlarge the Atlantic Ocean<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Growth of Continents</strong><br>&nbsp; The moving continents collided with island arcs and microcontinents. Mountain ranges grew near the continents&rsquo; edges. The oceanic Farallon plate subducted beneath western North America during the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous. This activity produced igneous intrusions and other structures. The intrusions have since been uplifted. They are exposed in the Sierra Nevada Mountains</span></p>
    <p><strong><span style='font-size:38px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>d. The Cenozoic Era</span></strong><span style='font-size:38px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Cenozoic began around 65.5 million years ago and continues today. Although it accounts for only about 1.5% of the Earth&rsquo;s total history, as the most recent era it is the one scientists know the most about. Much of what has been discussed elsewhere in Concepts Earth Science describes the geological situation of the Cenozoic. A few highlights are mentioned here.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Plate Tectonics</strong><br>&nbsp; The paleogeography of the era was very much like it is today. Early in the Cenozoic, blocks of crust uplifted to form the Rocky Mountains, which were later eroded away and then uplifted again. Subduction off of the Pacific Northwest formed the Cascades volcanic arc. The Basin and Range province that centers on Nevada is where crust is being pulled apart.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Evolution of the San Andreas Fault</strong><br>&nbsp; The San Andreas Fault has grown where the Pacific and North American plates meet. The plate tectonic evolution of that plate boundary is complex and interesting (Figure 132). The Farallon Plate was subducting beneath the North American Plate 30 Ma. By 20 Ma the Pacific Plate and East Pacific Rise spreading center had started to subduct, splitting the Farallon Plate into two smaller plates. Transform motion where the Pacific and North American plates meet formed the San Andreas Fault. The fault moved inland and, at present, small sea-floor spreading basins, along with the transform motion of the San Andreas, are splitting Baja California from mainland Mexico. Although most plate tectonic activity involves continents moving apart, smaller regions are coming together. Africa collided with Eurasia to create the Alps. India crashed into Asia to form the Himalayas.</span></p>
