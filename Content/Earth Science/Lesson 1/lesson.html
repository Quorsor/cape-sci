What are Rocks?</span></strong><span style='font-size:16px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;A rock is a naturally formed, non-living Earth material. Rocks are made of collections of mineral grains that are held together in a firm, solid mass. How is a rock different from a mineral? Rocks are made of minerals.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The mineral grains in a rock may be so tiny that you can only see them with a microscope, or they may be as big as your fingernail or even your finger<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Texture is a description of the size, shape, and arrangement of mineral grains. Rocks are identified primarily by the minerals they contain and by their texture. Each type of rock has a distinctive set of minerals. A rock may be made of grains of all one mineral type, such as quartzite. Much more commonly, rocks are made of a mixture of different minerals<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;A few rocks are not made of minerals at all. Coal, for example, is made of organic material, which is not a mineral. Can you think of other rocks that are not made of minerals?
