From space, Earth is a blue ball, unlike any of the other planets in our solar system. Life, also unique to Earth of the planets in our solar system, depends on this water. While there&apos;s a lot of salt water, a surprisingly small amount of it is fresh water.<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Distribution of Water</strong><br>&nbsp; Earth&rsquo;s oceans contain 97% of the planet&rsquo;s water. That leaves just 3% as fresh water, water with low concentrations of salts. Most fresh water is trapped as ice in the vast glaciers and ice sheets of Greenland. How is the 3% of fresh water divided into different reservoirs? How much of that water is useful for living creatures? How much for people?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;A storage location for water such as an ocean, glacier, pond, or even the atmosphere is known as a reservoir. A water molecule may pass through a reservoir very quickly or may remain for much longer. The amount of time a molecule stays in a reservoir is known as its residence time</span></p>

Seasons</span></strong><span style="font-size:38px;line-height:107%;"><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Earth&rsquo;s Seasons, Weather, and Climate A common misconception is that the Sun is closer to Earth in the summer and farther away from it during the winter. Instead, the seasons are caused by the 23.5o tilt of Earth&rsquo;s axis of rotation relative to its plane of orbit around the Sun (Figure 172). Solstice refers to the position of the Sun when it is closest to one of the poles. At summer solstice, June 21 or 22, Earth&rsquo;s axis points toward the Sun and so the Sun is directly overhead at its furthest north point of the year, the Tropic of Cancer (23.5o N).<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;During the summer, areas north of the equator experience longer days and shorter nights. In the Southern Hemisphere, the Sun is as far away as it will be and so it is their winter. Locations will have longer nights and shorter days. The opposite occurs on winter solstice, which begins on December 21. More about seasons can be found in the &quot;Atmospheric Processes&quot; concept<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Solar Radiation on Earth Different parts of the Earth receive different amounts of solar radiation. Which part of the planet receives the most solar radiation? The Sun&apos;s rays strike the surface most directly at the equator.</span></p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size:38px;line-height:107%;">&nbsp;Different areas also receive different amounts of sunlight in different seasons. What causes the seasons? The seasons are caused by the direction Earth&apos;s axis is pointing relative to the Sun.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; The Earth revolves around the Sun once each year and spins on its axis of rotation once each day. This axis of rotation is tilted 23.5o relative to its plane of orbit around the Sun. The axis of rotation is pointed toward Polaris, the North Star. As the Earth orbits the Sun, the tilt of Earth&apos;s axis stays lined up with the North Star.</span></p>
                    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size:38px;line-height:107%;">&nbsp;<strong>Northern Hemisphere Summer</strong><br>&nbsp; The North Pole is tilted towards the Sun and the Sun&apos;s rays strike the Northern Hemisphere more directly in summer. At the summer solstice, June 21 or 22, the Sun&apos;s rays hit the Earth most directly along the Tropic of Cancer (23.5oN); that is, the angle of incidence of the sun&rsquo;s rays there is zero (the angle of incidence is the deviation in the angle of an incoming ray from straight on). When it is summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere.<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Northern Hemisphere Winter</strong><br>&nbsp; Winter solstice for the Northern Hemisphere happens on December 21 or 22. The tilt of Earth&apos;s axis points away from the Sun . Light from the Sun is spread out over a larger area, so that area isn&apos;t heated as much. With fewer daylight hours in winter, there is also less time for the Sun to warm the area. When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere.<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Equinox</strong><br>&nbsp; Halfway between the two solstices, the Sun&apos;s rays shine most directly at the equator, called an equinox. The daylight and nighttime hours are exactly equal on an equinox. The autumnal equinox happens on September 22 or 23 and the vernal, or spring, equinox happens March 21 or 22 in the Northern Hemisphere.</span></p>

Atmosphere</span></strong><span style="font-size:38px;line-height:107%;"><br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>What Is the Atmosphere?</strong><br>&nbsp; Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere is a thin blanket of gases and tiny particles &mdash; together called air. We are most aware of air when it moves and creates wind. Earth&apos;s atmosphere, along with the abundant liquid water at Earth&rsquo;s surface, is the keys to our planet&apos;s unique place in the solar system. Much of what makes Earth exceptional depends on the atmosphere. For example, all living things need some of the gases in air for life support. Without an atmosphere, Earth would likely be just another lifeless rock. Let&apos;s consider some of the reasons we are lucky to have an atmosphere.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Without the atmosphere, Earth would look a lot more like the Moon. Atmospheric gases, especially carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2), are extremely important for living organisms. How does the atmosphere make life possible? How does life alter the atmosphere?<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Photosynthesis</strong><br>&nbsp; In photosynthesis, plants use CO2 and create O2. Photosynthesis is responsible for nearly all of the oxygen currently found in the atmosphere.<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Respiration</strong><br>&nbsp; By creating oxygen and food, plants have made an environment that is favorable for animals. In respiration, animals use oxygen to convert sugar into food energy they can use. Plants also go through respiration and consume some of the sugars they produce.<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Crucial Part of the Water Cycle</strong><br>&nbsp; As part of the hydrologic cycle, water spends a lot of time in the atmosphere, mostly as water vapor. The atmosphere is an important reservoir for water.<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Ozone Makes Life on Earth Possible</strong><br>&nbsp; Ozone is a molecule composed of three oxygen atoms, (O3). Ozone in the upper atmosphere absorbs high-energy ultraviolet (UV) radiation coming from the Sun. This protects living things on Earth&rsquo;s surface from the Sun&rsquo;s most harmful rays. Without ozone for protection, only the simplest life forms would be able to live on Earth. The highest concentration of ozone is in the ozone layer in the lower stratosphere.<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Keeps Earth&rsquo;s Temperature Moderate</strong><br>&nbsp; Along with the oceans, the atmosphere keeps Earth&apos;s temperatures within an acceptable range. Without an atmosphere, Earth&apos;s temperatures would be frigid at night and scorching during the day. If the 12-year-old in the scenario above asked why, she would find out. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere. Important greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and ozone.<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Water Vapor</strong><br>&nbsp; Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. Humidity varies from place to place and season to season. This fact is obvious if you compare a summer day in Atlanta, Georgia, where humidity is high, with a winter day in Phoenix, Arizona, where humidity is low. When the air is very humid, it feels heavy or sticky. Dry air usually feels more comfortable. When humidity is high, water vapor makes up only about 4% of the atmosphere.</span></p>

Important natural greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and ozone. CFCs and some other manmade compounds are also greenhouse gases.<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Particulates</strong><br>&nbsp; Some of what is in the atmosphere is not gas. Particles of dust, soil, fecal matter, metals, salt, smoke, ash, and other solids make up a small percentage of the atmosphere and are called particulates. Particles provide starting points (or nuclei) for water vapor to condense on and form raindrops. Some particles are pollutants.</span></p>

Weather</span></strong><span style="font-size:38px;line-height:107%;"><br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>What is Weather?</strong><br>&nbsp; All weather takes place in the atmosphere, virtually all of it in the lower atmosphere. Weather describes what the atmosphere is like at a specific time and place. A location&rsquo;s weather depends on:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&bull; air temperature&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&bull; air pressure&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&bull; fog &bull; humidity&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&bull; cloud cover&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&bull; precipitation&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&bull; wind speed and direction<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Weather is the change we experience from day to day. Weather can change rapidly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <strong>What Causes Weather?</strong><br>&nbsp; Weather occurs because of unequal heating of the atmosphere. The source of heat is the sun. The general principles behind weather can be stated simply:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&bull; The sun heats Earth&rsquo;s surface more in some places than in others.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&bull; Where it is warm, heat from the sun warms the air close to the surface. If there is water at the surface, it may cause some of the water to evaporate.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&bull; Warm air is less dense, so it rises. When this happens, more dense air flows in to take its place. The flowing surface air is wind.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&bull; The rising air cools as it goes higher in the atmosphere. If it is moist, the water vapor may condense. Clouds may form, and precipitation may fall.</span></p>

Climate</span></strong><span style='font-size:38px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>What is Climate?</strong><br>&nbsp; Although almost anything can happen with the weather, climate is more predictable. The weather on a particular winter day in San Diego may be colder than on the same day in Lake Tahoe, but, on average, Tahoe&rsquo;s winter climate is significantly colder than San Diego&rsquo;s<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Climate is the long-term average of weather in a particular spot. Good climate is why we choose to vacation in Hawaii in February, even though the weather is not guaranteed to be good! A location&rsquo;s climate can be described by its air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and the type, quantity, and frequency of precipitation.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;quantity, and frequency of precipitation. The climate for a particular place is steady, and changes only very slowly. Climate is determined by many factors, including the angle of the Sun, the likelihood of cloud cover, and the air<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;pressure. All of these factors are related to the amount of energy that is found in that location over time.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The climate of a region depends on its position relative to many things. These factors are described in the next sections.</span></p>
