Again, the answer came about in part due to war. In this case, the Cold War.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; During the 1950s and early 1960s, scientists set up seismograph networks to see if enemy nations were testing atomic bombs. These seismographs also recorded all of the earthquakes around the planet. The seismic records were used to locate an earthquake&rsquo;s epicenter, the point on Earth&rsquo;s surface directly above the place where the earthquake occurs.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Why is this relevant? It turns out that earthquake epicenters outline the plates. This is because earthquakes occur everywhere plates come into contact with each other.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The lithosphere is divided into a dozen major and several minor plates. A single plate can be made of all oceanic lithosphere or all continental lithosphere, but nearly all plates are made of a combination of both.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The movement of the plates over Earth&apos;s surface is termed plate tectonics. Plates move at a rate of a few centimeters a year, about the same rate fingernails grow.</span></p>

How Plates Move</span></strong><span style="font-size:38px;line-height:107%;"><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;If seafloor spreading drives the plates, what drives seafloor spreading?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;1. Hot mantle from the two adjacent cells rises at the ridge axis, creating new ocean crust.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size:38px;line-height:107%;">2. The top limb of the convection cell moves horizontally away from the ridge crest, as does the new seafloor.&nbsp;</span></p>

The outer limbs of the convection cells plunge down into the deeper mantle, dragging oceanic crust as well. This takes place at the deep sea trenches.&nbsp;</span></p>

How can two plates move relative to each other? Most geologic activities, including volcanoes, earthquakes, and mountain building, take place at plate boundaries. The features found at these plate boundaries are the mid-ocean ridges, trenches, and large transform faults<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&bull; Divergent plate boundaries: the two plates move away from each other.&nbsp;</span></p>

We can visit each of these types of plate boundaries on land or at sea.</span></p>

Plate Tectonics and the Past</span></strong><span style="font-size:38px;line-height:107%;"><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Wegener&rsquo;s persistent search for evidence that the continents had been joined paid off. Scientists who came after him developed an understanding of seafloor spreading, which was the mechanism for Wegener&rsquo;s continental drift. Geologists know that Wegener was right because the movements of continents explain so much about the geological activity we see.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size:38px;line-height:107%;">The existence of Wegener&rsquo;s supercontinent Pangaea is completely accepted by geologists today. But did it all begin with Pangaea? Or were there other supercontinents that came before?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Plate Tectonics Theory First, let&rsquo;s review plate tectonics theory. Plate tectonics theory explains why:&nbsp;</span></p>

Those mountains rose at the convergent plate boundaries where the continents were smashing together to create Pangaea. As Pangaea came together about 300 million years ago, an ocean where the Atlantic is now separated the continents. The proto-Atlantic ocean shrank as the Pacific Ocean grew<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Appalachian mountains of eastern North America formed at a convergent plate boundary as Pangaea came together. About 200 million years ago, they were probably as high as the Himalayas, but they have been weathered and eroded significantly since the breakup of Pangaea<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Pangaea has been breaking apart since about 250 million years ago. Divergent plate boundaries formed within the continents to cause them to rift apart. The continents are still moving apart, since the Pacific is shrinking as the Atlantic is growing. If the continents continue in their current directions, they will come together to create a supercontinent on the other side of the planet in around 200 million years<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;If you go back before Pangaea there were earlier supercontinents, such as Rodinia, which existed 750 million to 1.1 billion years ago, and Columbia, at 1.5 to 1.8 billion years ago. This supercontinent cycle is responsible for most of the geologic features that we see and many more that are long gone.</span></p>
