Star Power<br>&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;"><br>&nbsp;The Sun is Earth&rsquo;s major source of energy, yet the planet only receives a small portion of its energy. The Sun is just an ordinary star. Many stars produce much more energy than the Sun. The energy source for all stars is nuclear fusion.<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Nuclear Fusion</strong><br>&nbsp; Stars are made mostly of hydrogen and helium, which are packed so densely in a star that in the star&rsquo;s center the pressure is great enough to initiate nuclear fusion reactions. In anuclear fusion reaction, the nuclei of two atoms combine to create a new atom. Most commonly, in the core of a star, two hydrogen atoms fuse to become a helium atom. Although nuclear fusion reactions require a lot of energy to get started, once they are going they produce enormous amounts of energy<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;In a star, the energy from fusion reactions in the core pushes outward to balance the inward pull of gravity. This energy moves outward through the layers of the star until it finally reaches the star&rsquo;s outer surface. The outer layer of the star glows brightly, sending the energy out into space as electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, heat, ultraviolet light, and radio waves<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>b. Classification of Stars</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Why are the stars in Orion&apos;s Belt different colors?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The ancient Greeks thought this group of stars looked like a hunter, so they named it Orion after their mythical hunter. The line of three stars at the center is &quot;Orion&apos;s Belt.&quot; The many different colors of stars reflect the star&rsquo;s temperature. The bright, red star in the upper left, named Betelgeuse (pronounced BET-ul-juice), is not as hot than the blue star in the lower right, named Rigel.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Color and Temperature Think about how the color of a piece of metal changes with temperature. A coil of an electric stove will start out black, but with added heat will start to glow a dull red. With more heat, the coil turns a brighter red, then orange. At extremely high temperatures the coil will turn yellowwhite, or even blue-white (it&rsquo;s hard to imagine a stove coil getting that hot). A star&rsquo;s color is also determined by the temperature of the star&rsquo;s surface. Relatively cool stars are red, warmer stars are orange or yellow, and extremely hot stars are blue or blue-white<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Classifying Stars by Color</strong><br>&nbsp; Color is the most common way to classify stars. Relatively cool stars are red, warmer stars are orange or yellow, and extremely hot stars are blue or blue-white.</span></p>

Life Cycle of Stars<br>&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="font-size:16px;line-height:107%;"><br> <strong>What changes do stars undergo in their lifetimes?</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Stars have a life cycle, just like people: they are born, grow, change over time, and eventually grow old and die. Most stars change in size, color, and class at least once in their lifetime. What astronomers know about the life cycles of stars is because of data gathered from visual, radio, and X-ray telescopes.<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Star Formation</strong><br>&nbsp;Stars are born in clouds of gas and dust called nebulas<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>The Main Sequence</strong><br>&nbsp; For most of a star&rsquo;s life, nuclear fusion in the core produces helium from hydrogen. A star in this stage is a main sequence star. For stars on the main sequence, temperature is directly related to brightness. A star is on the main sequence as long as it is able to balance the inward force of gravity with the outward force of nuclear fusion in its core. The more massive a star, the more it must burn hydrogen fuel to prevent gravitational collapse. Because they burn more fuel, more massive stars have higher temperatures. Massive stars also run out of hydrogen sooner than smaller stars do.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Our Sun has been a main sequence star for about 5 billion years and will continue on the main sequence for about 5 billion more years. Very large stars may be on the main sequence for only 10 million years. Very small stars may last tens to hundreds of billions of years.<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Red Giants and White Dwarfs</strong><br>&nbsp; As a star begins to use up its hydrogen, it fuses helium atoms together into heavier atoms such as carbon. A blue giant star has exhausted its hydrogen fuel and is in a transitional phase. When the light elements are mostly used up, the star can no longer resist gravity and starts to collapse inward. The outer layers of the star grow outward and cool. The larger, cooler star turns red in color and so is called a red giant.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Eventually, a red giant burns up all of the helium in its core. What happens next depends on how massive the star is. A typical star, such as the Sun, stops fusion completely. Gravitational collapse shrinks the star&apos;s core to a white, glowing object about the size of Earth, called a white dwarf. A white dwarf will ultimately fade out.<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Supergiants and Supernovas</strong>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;A star that runs out of helium will end its life much more dramatically. When very massive stars leave the main sequence, they become red supergiants<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Unlike a red giant, when all the helium in a red supergiant is gone, fusion continues. Lighter atoms fuse into heavier atoms up to iron atoms. Creating elements heavier than iron through fusion uses more energy than it produces, so stars do not ordinarily form any heavier elements. When there are no more elements for the star to fuse, the core succumbs to gravity and collapses, creating a violent explosion called a supernova. A supernova explosion contains so much energy that atoms can fuse together to produce heavier elements such as gold, silver, and uranium. A supernova can shine as brightly as an entire galaxy for a short time. All elements with an atomic number greater than that of lithium were formed by nuclear fusion in stars.<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Neutron Stars</strong><br>&nbsp; After a supernova explosion, the leftover material in the core is extremely dense. If the core is less than about four times the mass of the Sun, the star becomes a neutron star. A neutron star is more massive than the Sun, but only a few kilometers in diameter. A neutron star is made almost entirely of neutrons, relatively large particles that have no electrical charge.<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Black Hole</strong>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;If the core remaining after a supernova is more than about five times the mass of the Sun, the core collapses into a black hole. Black holes are so dense that not even light can escape their gravity. With no light, a black hole cannot be observed directly. But a black hole can be identified by the effect that it has on objects around it, and by radiation that leaks out around its edges.</span></p>
