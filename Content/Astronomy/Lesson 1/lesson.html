Most can do experiments to test those materials. Biologists can collect cells, seeds, or sea urchins to study in the laboratory. Physicists can test the strength of metal or smash atoms into each other. Geologists can chip away at rocks and test their chemistry. What can astronomers use to study space? Light and other electromagnetic waves, of course. This is the Andromeda Galaxy as it appeared 2.5 million years ago. Why is the light so old?<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>The Speed of Light</strong><br>&nbsp; In space, light travels at about 300,000,000 meters per second (670,000,000 miles per hour). How fast is that? A beam of light could travel from New York to Los Angeles and back again nearly 40 times in just one second. Even at that amazing rate, objects in space are so far away that it takes a lot of time for their light to reach us. Even light from the nearest star, our sun, takes about eight minutes to reach Earth.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Light-Years</strong><br>&nbsp; We need a really big unit to measure distances out in space because distances between stars are so great. A light-year, 9.5 trillion kilometers (5.9 trillion miles), is the distance that light travels in one year. That&rsquo;s a long way! Out in space, it&rsquo;s actually a pretty short distance.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Proxima Centauri is the closest star to us after the Sun. This near neighbor is 4.22 light-years away. That means the light from Proxima Centauri takes 4.22 years to reach us. Our galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy, is about 100,000 light-years across. So it takes light 100,000 years to travel from one side of the galaxy to the other! It turns out that even 100,000 light years is a short distance. The most distant galaxies we have detected are more than 13 billion light-years away. That&rsquo;s over a hundred-billion-trillion kilometers!<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Looking Back in Time</strong><br>&nbsp; When we look at stars and galaxies, we are seeing over great distances. More importantly, we are also seeing back in time. When we see a distant galaxy, we are actually seeing how the galaxy used to look. For example, the Whirlpool Galaxy is about 23 million light-years from Earth (Figure 222). When you see an image of the galaxy what are you seeing? You are seeing the galaxy as it was 23 million years ago!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Since scientists can look back in time, they can better understand the Universe&apos;s history.</span></p>

    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><span style="font-size:38px;line-height:107%;">Certainly no one today doubts that Earth orbits a star, the Sun. Photos taken from space, observations made by astronauts, and the fact that there has been so much successful space exploration that depends on understanding the structure of the solar system all confirm it. But in the early 17th century saying that Earth orbited the Sun rather than the reverse could get you tried for heresy, as it did Galileo. Let&rsquo;s explore the evolution of the idea that Earth orbits the Sun<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>The Geocentric Universe</strong><br>&nbsp; To an observer, Earth appears to be the center of the universe. That is what the ancient Greeks believed. This view is called the geocentric model, or &quot;Earth-centered&quot; model, of the universe. In the geocentric model, the sky, or heavens, are a set of spheres layered on top of one another. Each object in the sky is attached to a sphere and moves around Earth as that sphere rotates. From Earth outward, these spheres contain the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. An outer sphere holds all the stars. Since the planets appear to move much faster than the stars, the Greeks placed them closer to Earth. The geocentric model explained why all the stars appear to rotate around Earth once per day. The model also explained why the planets move differently from the stars and from each other<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;One problem with the geocentric model is that some planets seem to move backwards (in retrograde) instead of in their usual forward motion around Earth.<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>The Heliocentric Universe</strong><br>&nbsp; Ptolemy&rsquo;s geocentric model worked, but it was complicated and occasionally made errors in predicting the movement of planets. At the beginning of the 16th century A.D., Nicolaus Copernicus proposed that Earth and all the other planets orbit the Sun. With the Sun at the center, this model is called the heliocentric model, or &quot;sun-centered&quot; model.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; Although Copernicus&rsquo; model was simpler &ndash; it didn&rsquo;t need epicycles and deferents - it still did not perfectly describe the motion of the planets. Johannes Kepler solved the problem a short time later when he determined that the planets moved around the Sun in ellipses (ovals), not circles. Kepler&rsquo;s model matched observations perfectly.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The heliocentric model did not catch on right away. When Galileo Galilei first turned a telescope to the heavens in 1610, he made several striking discoveries. Galileo discovered that the planet Jupiter has moons orbiting around it. This provided the first evidence that objects could orbit something besides Earth.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Galileo also discovered that Venus has phases like the Moon, which provides direct evidence that Venus orbits the Sun.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Galileo&rsquo;s discoveries caused many more people to accept the heliocentric model of the universe, although Galileo himself was found guilty of heresy. The shift from an Earth-centered view to a Sun-centered view of the universe is referred to as the Copernican Revolution.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;In their elliptical orbits, each planet is sometimes farther away from the Sun than at other times. This movement is called revolution. At the same time, Earth spins on its axis. Earth&rsquo;s axis is an imaginary line passing through the planet&rsquo;s center that goes through both the North Pole and the South Pole. This spinning movement is called Earth&rsquo;s rotation.</span></p>
    <p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><strong><span style="font-size:44px;line-height:107%;">Earth&rsquo;s Revolution</span></strong><span style="font-size:38px;line-height:107%;"><br>&nbsp; Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler were all right: Earth and the other planets travel in an elliptical orbit around the Sun. The gravitational pull of the Sun keeps the planets in orbit. This ellipse is barely elliptical; it&apos;s very close to being a circle. The closest Earth gets to the Sun each year is at perihelion (147 million km) on about January 3rd, and the furthest is at aphelion (152 million km) on July 4th. The shape of Earth&rsquo;s orbit has nothing to do with Earth&apos;s seasons.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;For Earth to make one complete revolution around the Sun takes 365.24 days. This amount of time is the definition of one year. Earth has one large moon, which orbits Earth once every 29.5 days, a period known as a month.</span></p>

Eclipses</span></strong><span style="font-size:38px;line-height:107%;"><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Solar Eclipses A solar eclipse occurs when the new Moon passes directly between the Earth and the Sun. This casts a shadow on the Earth and blocks Earth&rsquo;s view of the Sun. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon&rsquo;s shadow completely blocks the Sun. When only a portion of the Sun is out of view, it is called a partial solar eclipse. Solar eclipses are rare and usually only last a few minutes because the Moon casts only a small shadow<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;As the Sun is covered by the moon&rsquo;s shadow, it will actually get cooler outside. Birds may begin to sing, and stars will become visible in the sky. During a solar eclipse, the corona and solar prominences can be seen.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun in such a way that the Sun is either partially or totally hidden from view. Some people, including some scientists, chase eclipses all over the world to learn or just observe this amazing phenomenon.<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>Lunar Eclipse</strong><br>&nbsp; A lunar eclipse occurs when the full moon moves through Earth&rsquo;s shadow, which only happens when Earth is between the Moon and the Sun and all three are lined up in the same plane, called the ecliptic. In an eclipse, Earth&rsquo;s shadow has two distinct parts: the umbra and the penumbra. The umbra is the inner, cone-shaped part of the shadow, in which all of the light has been blocked. The penumbra is the outer part of Earth&rsquo;s shadow where only part of the light is blocked. In the penumbra, the light is dimmed but not totally absent<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon travels completely in Earth&rsquo;s umbra. During a partial lunar eclipse, only a portion of the Moon enters Earth&rsquo;s umbra. Earth&rsquo;s shadow is large enough that a lunar eclipse lasts for hours and can be seen by any part of Earth with a view of the Moon at the time of the eclipse. A lunar eclipse does not occur every month because Moon&apos;s orbit is inclined 5- degrees to Earth&apos;s orbit, so the two bodies are not in the same plane every month.</span></p>
    <p><strong><span style='font-size:44px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>c. Phases of the Moon</span></strong><span style='font-size:38px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The moon does not produce any light of its own. It only reflects light from the sun. The moon has phases because it orbits around Earth. One orbit takes about 28 days. As the moon moves around Earth, different parts of it appear to be lit up by the sun. The moon sometimes appears fully lit and sometimes completely dark. Sometimes it is partially lit. The different appearances of the moon are referred to as phases of the moon<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;A full moon occurs when the whole side facing Earth is lit. This happens when Earth is between the moon and the sun.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;About one week later, the moon enters the quarter-moon phase. Only half of the moon&rsquo;s lit surface is visible from Earth, so it appears as a half circle.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Another week later, the moon moves between Earth and the sun. The side of the moon facing Earth is completely dark. This is called a new moon. Sometimes you can just barely make out the outline of the new moon in the sky. This is because some sunlight reflects off the Earth and hits the moon.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;One week after that, the moon is in another quarter-moon phase. Finally, in one more week, the moon is back to full.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Before and after the quarter-moon phases are the gibbous and crescent phases. During the crescent moon phase, the moon is less than half lit. It is seen as only a sliver or crescent shape. During the gibbous moon phase, the moon is more than half lit. It is not full. The moon undergoes a complete cycle of phases about every 29.5 days.<br>&nbsp;</span></p>
