As the vehicle moves toward you, the sound waves are pushed together. As the vehicle moves past you, the waves are spread apart. Though redshift involves light instead of sound, a similar principle operates in both situations.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;After discovering that there are galaxies beyond the Milky Way, Edwin Hubble went on to measure the distance to hundreds of other galaxies. His data would eventually show how the universe is changing, and would even yield clues as to how the universe formed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Redshift If you look at a star through a prism, you will see a spectrum, or a range of colors through the rainbow. The spectrum will have specific dark bands where elements in the star absorb light of certain energies. By examining the arrangement of these dark absorption lines, astronomers can determine the composition of elements that make up a distant star. In fact, the element helium was first discovered in our Sun &mdash; not on Earth &mdash; by analyzing the absorption lines in the spectrum of the Sun.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;While studying the spectrum of light from distant galaxies, astronomers noticed something strange. The dark lines in the spectrum were in the patterns they expected, but they were shifted toward the red end of the spectrum. This shift of absorption bands toward the red end of the spectrum is known as redshift.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Redshift occurs when the light source is moving away from the observer or when the space between the observer and the source is stretched. What does it mean that stars and galaxies are redshifted? When astronomers see redshift in the light from a galaxy, they know that the galaxy is moving away from Earth.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;If galaxies were moving randomly, would some be redshifted but others be blueshifted? Of course. Since almost every galaxy in the universe has a redshift, almost every galaxy is moving away from Earth.<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>a. The Expanding Universe</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Edwin Hubble combined his measurements of the distances to galaxies with other astronomers&rsquo; measurements of redshift. From this data, he noticed a relationship, which is now called Hubble&rsquo;s Law: the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from us. What could this mean about the universe? It means that the universe is expanding.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;One way to picture this is to imagine a balloon covered with tiny dots to represent the galaxies. When you inflate the balloon, the dots slowly move away from each other because the rubber stretches in the space between them. If you were standing on one of the dots, you would see the other dots moving away from you. Also, the dots farther away from you on the balloon would move away faster than dots nearby.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;An inflating balloon is only a rough analogy to the expanding universe for several reasons. One important reason is that the surface of a balloon has only two dimensions, while space has three dimensions. But space itself is stretching out between galaxies, just as the rubber stretches when a balloon is inflated. This stretching of space, which increases the distance between galaxies, is what causes the expansion of the universe.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;One other difference between the universe and a balloon involves the actual size of the galaxies. On a balloon, the dots will become larger in size as you inflate it. In the universe, the galaxies stay the same size; only the space between the galaxies increases.</span></p>
    <p><strong><span style='font-size:44px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>b. The Big Bang Theory</span></strong><span style='font-size:38px;line-height:107%;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Big Bang theory is the most widely accepted cosmological explanation of how the universe formed. If we start at the present and go back into the past, the universe is contracting &mdash; getting smaller and smaller. What is the end result of a contracting universe?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;According to the Big Bang theory, the universe began about 13.7 billion years ago. Everything that is now in the universe was squeezed into a very small volume. Imagine all of the known universe in a single, hot, chaotic mass. An enormous explosion &mdash; a big bang &mdash; caused the universe to start expanding rapidly. All the matter and energy in the universe, and even space itself, came out of this explosion.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;What came before the Big Bang? There is no way for scientists to know since there is no remaining evidence.<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong>After the Big Bang</strong><br>&nbsp; In the first few moments after the Big Bang, the universe was unimaginably hot and dense. As the universe expanded, it became less dense and began to cool. After only a few seconds, protons, neutrons, and electrons could form. After a few minutes, those subatomic particles came together to create hydrogen. Energy in the universe was great enough to initiate nuclear fusion, and hydrogen nuclei were fused into helium nuclei. The first neutral atoms that included electrons did not form until about 380,000 years later.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The matter in the early universe was not smoothly distributed across space. Dense clumps of matter held close together by gravity were spread around. Eventually, these clumps formed countless trillions of stars, billions of galaxies, and other structures that now form most of the visible mass of the universe.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;If you look at an image of galaxies at the far edge of what we can see, you are looking at great distances. But you are also looking across a different type of distance. What do those far away galaxies represent? Because it takes so long for light from so far away to reach us, you are also looking back in time.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Background Radiation After the origin of the Big Bang hypothesis, many astronomers still thought the universe was static. Nearly all came around when an important line of evidence for the Big Bang was discovered in 1964. In a static universe, the space between objects should have no heat at all; the temperature should measure 0 K (Kelvin is an absolute temperature scale). But two researchers at Bell Laboratories used a microwave receiver to learn that the background radiation in the universe is not 0 K, but 3 K. This tiny amount of heat is left over from the Big Bang. Since nearly all astronomers now accept the Big Bang hypothesis, what is it usually referred to as?<br>&nbsp;</span></p>
